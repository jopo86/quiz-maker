# Quiz Maker
A C++ terminal application to create, take, & share quizzes.

## Installation
To install, simply download the zip file below, extract it, and run QuizMaker.exe under the QuizMaker folder. Once downloaded, you can move the QuizMaker folder anywhere. Downloading from the latest release link may cause your browser to block the download because it thinks it is a suspicious file - this is just because it is infrequently downloaded. You can bypass this by clicking on the download blocked notification and downloading it anyway.  
[Latest Release (1.1.1)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1k3l_wHDy6yscD-kdj4t6BivnhCn1TYp6)

Windows may stop the program from running. This is because it does not recognize the application, which is normal. If this happens click 'More Info' and then 'Run anway'.

If this is confusing, see [installation](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki/Installation).

## How To Use
Like the terminal, this program runs based off (pseudo-)directories and commands that the user inputs. When the program starts you will be in the Root directory, shown as just `>`. From here you can enter any command that works in the Root directory or any directory.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki) contains [documentation](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki/Documentation) covering every command, as well as a friendly [tutorial](https://github.com/jopo86/QuizMaker/wiki/Tutorial).
